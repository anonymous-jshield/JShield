Zozzle-like Detection Engine:

This package is used for demonstrating Zozzle vulnerable to pollution attack.
	The event triggering engine, which, in order to de-obfuscate JavaScript, will execute all the scripts and trigger all the events in a HTML file, is not included due to the size of WebKit.
	For the users hoping to re-train the engine, please re-configure the database environement.
	For accuracy, the blacklist engine is automatically disabled. 


Set Up Environment:
	cd scripts
	set Java environement in set_env.sh
	source set_env.sh

Compilation:
	cd scripts
	./build.sh

Single File Detection:
	The input file should be a JavaScript file. Each code snippet starts with "[Source Code Start]" and ends with "[Source Code End]"
	Please refer to samples for examples

	cd scripts
	./run.sh 3 file_name 

Detection Files in One Directory:
	cd scripts
	run_in_batch.sh directory_to_be_detected list_of_file_names_in_arg1_to_be_detected
